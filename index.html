        <div class="subheading mb-5">Undergraduate StudentðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, this is Lisa Liu. My current occupation is a student, and I am currently a full-time undergraduate student at the University of California - Riverside. I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree in Studio Art with a 3.75 GPA. In my entire experience as a student at UCR, I have learned that everything will eventually pay off; the time you invest in studying for the course, your grade will show and reward your effort. That's what I believe in, and it can also apply to my career and my future life. I don't have work right now since participating as a full-time student has already occupied my 100% of my time and energy. <br><br>

          As an art major student, my biggest talent is photography. Capturing the moment for a great view, for my friends and family, or even for a scene that touched me can give me so much satisfaction. By adjusting the angle, light, and focal length, find the most appropriate parameter, press the shutter, and this moment will be captured for eternity. I have always thought that photography is a very romantic thing. Although you don't know how your relationship with this person will turn out in the future, at least in the present moment, your emotions will be fixed; no matter what the result is, what is shown in the photo is the most honest emotion. I also enjoy painting, drawing, and making sculptures work. Besides art, a fun fact about me is that I am really good at cooking. I'm not limited to a particular cuisine, and I am willing to try every dish as long as I like it. As of today, I have tried to make Chinese, Korean, Italian, American, and Thai food. But for a single cuisine that I'm an expert at cooking, there is no doubt Chinese food; my best and favorite dish is sweet and sour short ribs. Besides cooking, I also enjoy baking; seeing the batter slowly rising into a perfect cake in the oven just makes me so satisfied. During that process, my kitchen will fill with the bakery smell, and that is the best home fragrance in the whole world.<br><br>

          My initial plan upon graduation is to rest for a year and use that time to prepare a portfolio to apply for Art graduate school. I could also use that time to travel the world and experience different cultures, which I believe can also help with my inspiration for the portfolio. I don't want to rush into a job, so I'm planning to get two M.A. degrees in Fine Art and Art Therapy before I start my career. So, hopefully, after graduation, I could be a professional Art Therapist or even open my own therapy office. What I hope to accomplish with my early career is that I can totally depend on myself and gain valuable experience in both my job and life. Geographically, I really want to work and live in Los Angeles; I just love the weather here so much, and I also cherish the memories that I have of the past ten years that I spent in LA. What excites me the most about the idea of graduating from UCR to start the next chapter of my Life is that it is 100% new to me, and it's unpredictable. I wouldn't know who I'm going to meet, what challenge I will face, and what accomplish I will achieve, and that is fun.
